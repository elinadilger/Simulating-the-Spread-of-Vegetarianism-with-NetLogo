# Simulating-the-Spread-of-Vegetarianism-with-NetLogo
Code for the Netlogo simulation and explanation of the simulation

I offer an agent-based simulation with NetLogo that aims to give an intuition for the effect
of a higher meat price and the supply of meat substitutes on the consumption behaviour
of individuals. For this, I modelled the meat and meat-substitute market and based parts
of the simulation of sustainable behaviour on the paper and project 'Cultural Evolution of
Sustainable Behaviors: Pro-environmental Tipping Points in an Agent-Based Model' by
Roope Oskari Kaaronen and Nikita Strelkovskii (2020).
